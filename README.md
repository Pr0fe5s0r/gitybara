    <b>Gitybara is an autonomous AI developer built on top of OpenCode.</b><br>
    Most AI tools help you write code. Gitybara actually does the development.<br>
    It turns issues into branches, code, and pull requests — automatically.<br>
    <i>Instead of chatting with AI, you assign it work.</i>

## 🚀 What Gitybara Does

Gitybara transforms your GitHub workflow into an AI-driven development system.

1. You create an issue (or send a message via WhatsApp / Telegram).
2. Gitybara reads the task.
3. It selects the right AI model using labels.
4. It creates a branch.
5. It implements the solution using OpenCode.
6. It opens a pull request.
7. You review and merge.

That’s it.

No copy-paste.
No terminal juggling.
No AI chat babysitting.

## 🧠 Why It’s Different

Most AI coding assistants are:
- Chat-based
- Interactive
- Suggestion-driven
- Synchronous

Gitybara is:
- Issue-driven
- Autonomous
- Workflow-native
- Asynchronous
- Outcome-focused (PR ready)

It doesn’t assist.
It executes.
